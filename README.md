# Prevent Contact Delete
In the Netherlands, the taxpayer can deduct gifts to charities from his income tax.
    The tax authorities take samples and can ask a charity to report the gifts it received from a particular contact.
    The length of the period they can ask this is seven years.
    So the records of this contact must be kept in these years.
    This module prevents deleting or trashing a contact that has a contribution less old than seven years.
